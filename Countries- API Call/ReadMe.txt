This is the first API I am designing for seond round of Freshworks.

Features:
This is a simple API which has a search option.
The search function returns only the exact match ( I was not able to display multiple results due to lack of time)
The details of the country is displayed.
There is a go back option which redirects the page to the initial homepage and not the results page

Also 
The program doesnot iterate through the json object.

I am new to the subject of API Calls and JSON objects, so given more time I might be able to implement all the given features.
